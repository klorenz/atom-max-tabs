# max-tabs package

**Deprecated**, use https://atom.io/packages/tidy-tabs instead.


I tend to leave tabs open, and editing many files, they pile up.  This package
closes oldest unvisited tabs. Keeping you at a defined maximum number of tabs.

You can configure maximum tab count.  If you have multiple panes, number of
tabs is devided by number of panes.

TODO:
  check if panes are vertically or horizontally splitted and make maxTabs
  number dependend on this.
